# BMI Calculator Application

A simple JavaFX-based BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that allows users to calculate their BMI based on weight and height inputs, with support for both metric and English units (kilograms/meters and pounds/inches). The application displays the calculated BMI and provides a classification of the BMI status based on the user's input.

## Features

- **Input Fields**: Users can input their weight and height.
- **Unit Selection**: Choose between metric (kg/m) or English (lb/in) units.
- **Calculate BMI**: A button that calculates BMI based on the user's input.
- **BMI Status**: Displays BMI status (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) based on the calculated BMI.
- **Menu Options**:
  - "File" menu with options to **Exit** the application and **Clear** the input fields.
  - "Help" menu to display information on how to use the BMI calculator.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language for the application logic.
- **JavaFX**: Framework for building the user interface (UI).
- **FXML**: XML-based markup language for designing the UI in Scene Builder.
- **Scene Builder**: Tool to visually design the JavaFX user interface (FXML).

## Project Structure

- **src/main/java**: Contains Java source files (e.g., controllers and the main application class).
- **src/main/resources**: Contains FXML files and any other resources such as images or stylesheets.
